# Collected note on interview questions

I think
the most important part of the interview
is the conversation and the attitude that
the candidate shows in front of you (and your
other colleagues, if he does multiple
interview) but at the same time I usually
find myself comfortable discussing things
like "what do you think of multithreading?",
as these type of questions open the doors
for a broader and interesting discussion.

Questions are divided in different areas,
so I usually pick 5/6 question in total -- the
whole interview usually lasts up to 1 hour
as there is an introduction on the company,
the introduction of the candidate etc etc.
